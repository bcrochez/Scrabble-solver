Scrabble solver made in Python 3 by Bastien Crochez.

It uses iutk.py a pythom module from the IUT of Marne la Vallée to use easily Tkinter.

This program "plays" scrabble and find the best word with the gving letters.

There are two version:
- the main version uses the World's Fastest Scrabble Program (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15451-s06/www/lectures/scrabble.pdf)
- the "force brute" version finds all words possible with the giving letters and tests if they fit in each row and column.

/!\ THE PROGRAM NEEDS THE ODS6.txt TO WORKS PROPERLY /!\
I don't have any right to share the ODS6.
